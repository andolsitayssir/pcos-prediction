## Project Overview:
 This project aims to analyze PCOS-related datasets to identify key risk factors, predict diagnosis using machine learning models.

### 1. **Source of Data:**
   - The PCOS datasets are from Kaggle and include the following:
     - [PCOS_data_without_infertility](https://www.kaggle.com/code/psvenom/pcos-a-guide-to-practical-machine-learning-93-5?select=PCOS_data_without_infertility.xlsx)
     - [PCOS_infertility](https://www.kaggle.com/code/psvenom/pcos-a-guide-to-practical-machine-learning-93-5?select=PCOS_infertility.csv)
     - [PCOS_survey](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahilkoli04/pcos2023?select=CLEAN-+PCOS+SURVEY+SPREADSHEET.csv)


### 2. **Data Understanding and Cleaning:**
   - Ensure datasets are properly loaded and checked for issues like missing values, inconsistent formatting, or redundant columns, we can start by checking this common steps:
     - Summarizing data using descriptive statistics.
     - Extract insights and Visualize data distributions.
     - Understanding relationships between variables.
   - Ensure data are properly cleaned, we can start by checking this common steps:  
     - Handling missing values as appropriate.
     - Removing or correcting outliers, if they are errors or irrelevant.
     - Dealing with inconsistent formatting by Standardize and format categorical and numerical variables.

    **Output:**
      - Cleaned datasets ready for analysis. 

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Perform detailed analysis to extract meaningful insights from the datasets:
     - Descriptive statistics for all numerical features.
     - Create Visualizations to explore data distributions and correlations.
     - Analyze relationships between key variables. 

    **Output:** 
      - A report summarizing key insights.

### 4.**Data Transformation:**
   - Transform the data into a format suitable for machine learning models:
     - Transform categorial features to numerical features.
     - Feature engineering (transform raw data into relevant information).

    **Output:**
     - A well-prepared dataset ready for machine learning modeling.

### 4. **Machine Learning Models:**
   -  Build machine learning models to predict PCOS diagnosis::
     - Experiment with different algorithms.
     - Evaluate models using metrics.

    **Output:** 
     - Models performance metrics and a final chosen model.
     

### 5. **Activity and Workshop Recommendations:**
   - Throughout this project:
     - Internal Workshops: Organize workshops before each major task to align understanding and discuss techniques.
     - Study Groups: Encourage team members to share ideas, new machine learning trends, and relevant insights.
     - Quizzes: Conduct quizzes to test knowledge and reinforce learning.
